# 3.4.11 The Union Flag

## The Act of Union 1800:

- Ireland, despite sharing a monarch with England and Wales since Henry VIII, remained separate.
- The **Act of Union 1800** unified **Ireland** with England, Scotland, and Wales.
- This created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

## The Union Flag (Union Jack):

- A new version of the official flag, the **Union Flag (or Union Jack)**, symbolized this union.
- It combined crosses associated with England, Scotland, and Ireland.
- It remains the official flag of the UK today.

## Components of the Union Flag:

- St. **George's Cross (England)**: A **red cross on a white** background.
- St. **Andrew's Cross (Scotland)**: A **diagonal white cross on a blue background**.
- St. **Patrick's Cross (Ireland)**: A diagonal red cross on a white background.

- Tips:
    - England -> Red cross (most common). George is also an Britain King.
    - Ireland -> only northen Ireland -> Diagonal red cross
    - Scotland -> Isle of Skye -> blue sky -> blue background


## Absence of the Welsh Dragon:

- Wales has its own official flag featuring a Welsh dragon.
- The Welsh dragon is not on the Union Flag.
- This is because Wales was already united with England when the first Union Flag was created in 1606 (combining the flags of Scotland and England).
