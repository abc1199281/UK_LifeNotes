# 3.4.1 Constitutional monarchy — the Bill of Rights

## Constitutional Monarchy and the Bill of Rights:
- The Declaration of Rights, **read at William and Mary's coronation**, limited the monarch's *power to raise taxes and administer justice without Parliament's consent*.
- **The Bill of Rights (1689)** codified Parliament's rights and the limits of the monarch's power.
- *Parliament took control of who could be monarch*, requiring the monarch to be *Protestant*.
- Parliamentary elections were mandated at least every three years (later changed to seven, and now five).
- *Annual parliamentary approval* was required for military funding.

## Development of Ministerial Government and Party Politics:

- **Effective governance** required the monarch to have ministers who could **secure parliamentary majorities**.
- The emergence of the *Whig* and *Tory* parties marked the beginning of *party politics*.

## Growth of a Free Press:

- From **1695**, newspapers operated **without government licensing**.
- Increased newspaper publication.

## Characteristics of the Evolving Political System:

- The laws following the Glorious Revolution established a **‘constitutional monarchy’**.
- The monarch's power was significantly reduced, with Parliament holding greater authority.
- Ministers gained influence over the monarch.
- The system was not a modern democracy:
    - Voting rights were restricted to *property-owning men*.
    - Women were excluded from voting.
    - **‘Pocket boroughs’** were controlled by wealthy families.
    - **'Rotten boroughs'** had very few voters.
