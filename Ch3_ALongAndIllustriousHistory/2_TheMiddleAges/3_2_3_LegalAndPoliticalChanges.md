# 3.2.3 Legal And Political Changes

- Parliament's Origins:
    - The institution of Parliament began to form during the Middle Ages, evolving from the **king's council of advisers** which included **nobles and Church leaders**.

## **Magna Carta (1215)**:
- Before 1215, there were few formal restrictions on the king's power.
- **King John** was compelled by his noblemen to accept a set of demands, resulting in the **Magna Carta (Great Charter)**.
- Key Principles:
    - Established that the king was also subject to the law,
    - protected the rights of the nobility
    - limited the king's ability to impose taxes or change laws unilaterally.
    - Required the king to consult with his nobles for major decisions in the future.

## Development of **English Parliament**:
- Kings summoned Parliament primarily to consult nobles, especially when needing to raise funds.
- Attendance grew, leading to the formation of two separate chambers (Houses).
- **House of Lords**:
    - nobles, major landowners, and bishops.
- **House of Commons**:
    - elected knights (often smaller landowners) and wealthy representatives from towns and cities.
- **Suffrage**:
    - Only a limited segment of the population had the right to vote for members of the House of Commons.

## Development of **Scottish Parliament**:
- Evolved along similar lines to the English Parliament.
- Consisted of **three Houses**, known as **Estates**:
    1. the lords,
    2. the commons,
    3. the clergy.

## Legal System Advancements
- The principle of **judges being independent from the government** started to take root.
- **England**: Judges developed **common law**, relying on *precedent (past rulings) and tradition*.
- **Scotland**: The legal system evolved differently, with laws being systematically **codified** (written down).
