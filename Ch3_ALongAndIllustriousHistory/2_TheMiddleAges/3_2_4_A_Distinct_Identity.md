# 3.2.4 A Distinct Identity

The Middle Ages saw the development of a national culture and identity.

## Development of a Distinct English Identity and Language:

- Cultural Fusion:
    - The Middle Ages fostered a unique national culture and identity in England.
- Language Evolution:
    - Anglo-Saxon (spoken by peasants) and Norman French (spoken by nobility after the Norman Conquest) gradually merged to form the English language.
- Word Origins:
    - Norman French roots: e.g., 'park', 'beauty'.
    - Anglo-Saxon roots: e.g., 'apple', 'cow', 'summer'.
- Synonyms from both origins exist:
    - e.g., 'demand' (French) and 'ask' (Anglo-Saxon).
- Official Language:
    - By 1400, English became the standard language for official documents, the royal court, and Parliament.

## Literature and Language in England and Scotland:

Geoffrey Chaucer: Wrote The Canterbury Tales in English around the lead-up to 1400, depicting pilgrims storytelling on their journey.
Printing Press: The Canterbury Tales was one of the first books printed in England by William Caxton using a printing press.
Enduring Popularity: Chaucer's stories remain popular, adapted into plays and TV shows.
Scotland: Gaelic continued to be spoken, and the Scots language developed.
Scottish Poets: Writers like John Barbour emerged, writing in Scots (e.g., The Bruce about the Battle of Bannockburn).

## Architectural Developments:

Castles: Built widely across Britain and Ireland, primarily for defence. Many are now ruins, but some like Windsor and Edinburgh Castles remain in use.
Cathedrals: Great cathedrals (e.g., Lincoln Cathedral) were constructed and many are still active places of worship.
Stained Glass: Cathedrals often featured stained glass windows depicting biblical stories and saints (e.g., the famous glass at York Minster).

## Trade and Immigration:

Trading Nation: England emerged as an important nation for trade during this period.
Key Export: English wool was a significant export product.
Immigration: People came to England from overseas for trade and work, bringing valuable skills.
Skilled Workers: Examples include weavers (France), engineers (Germany), glass manufacturers (Italy), and canal builders (Holland).
