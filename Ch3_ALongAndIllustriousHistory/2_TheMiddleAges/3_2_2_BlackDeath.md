# 3.2.2 The Black Death

## Feudal System:

- The Normans implemented a land ownership system called feudalism.
- Kings granted land to lords in exchange for military support (providing soldiers).
- Some peasants had their own land but most were **serfs**, bound to work on their lord's land in return for a small plot to grow their own food.
- Serfs were not permitted to leave the land.
- This feudal system also developed in **southern Scotland**.
- In **northern Scotland and Ireland**, land was typically owned by members of **clans** (prominent families).

## The Black Death:

- A devastating disease, likely a form of **plague**, arrived in Britain in **1348**.
- It caused the death of approximately **one-third** of England's population.
- Scotland and Wales experienced similar catastrophic population losses.
- It stands as one of the most severe disasters in British history.

## Impact and Consequences:

- Reduced Population:
    - Led to a decreased demand for cereal crop cultivation.
- Labour Shortages:
    - The significant loss of life created shortages of workers.
- Peasant Demands:
    - Surviving peasants began to demand *higher wages* due to labour scarcity.
- **New Social Classes**:
    - **Owners of large land areas**, later known as the **gentry**, emerged as a distinct social class.
- **Urban Migration**:
    - People started leaving rural areas to seek opportunities in towns.
- **Rise of Middle Class**:
    - Increased wealth in towns fostered the development of a strong middle class.
- Ireland:
    - The Black Death caused many deaths within the **English-controlled Pale**, leading to a temporary reduction in the size of the area under English rule.
