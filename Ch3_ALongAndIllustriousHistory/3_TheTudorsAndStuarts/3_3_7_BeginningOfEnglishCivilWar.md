# 3.3.7 The Beginning of English Civil War

## Religious Conflicts and Scottish Unrest:
- Charles I sought to introduce more ceremony into the Church of England's worship and implemented a revised Prayer Book.
- His attempt to impose this Prayer Book on the Presbyterian Church in Scotland caused significant unrest.
- A Scottish army was formed.
- Charles I needed parliamentary funds for his army but faced resistance.
- In 1640, he recalled Parliament to request financial aid.

## Parliamentary and Puritan Opposition:
- Many Parliament members were **Puritans**, advocating for strict and simple religious practices.
- They opposed the king's religious views and his reforms of the Church of England.
- Parliament refused to grant the king the requested funds, even after the Scottish army's invasion of England.

## Irish Rebellion and Parliamentary Demands:
- A rebellion erupted in Ireland due to *Roman Catholics'* fears of the **Puritans**' growing influence.
- Parliament seized this opportunity to demand control of the English army, shifting substantial power from the king.
- Charles I's attempt to arrest five parliamentary leaders in the House of Commons failed.
- This action significantly escalated tensions.

## The Start of the English Civil War:
- The failed arrest attempt made civil war inevitable.
- The **English Civil War** began in **1642**.
- The country divided into two factions:
    - Supporters of the king (**Cavaliers**).
    - Supporters of Parliament (**Roundheads**).
