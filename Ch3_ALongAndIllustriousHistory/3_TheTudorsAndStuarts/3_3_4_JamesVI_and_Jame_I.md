# 3.3.4 James VI and I

- He was James VI in Scotland and then became James I in England.

## Succession of James VI and I:
- Elizabeth I's lack of marriage and children led to her cousin, James VI of Scotland, inheriting the throne.
- Upon her death in 1603, he became *King James I of England, Wales, and Ireland.*
- *Scotland remained a separate country* despite the union of the crowns.

## The King James Bible:
- A significant achievement of King James I's reign was the creation of **a new English translation of the Bible**.
- This translation is known as the "*King James Version*" or the "*Authorised Version.*"
- While not the first English Bible, it remains widely used in many Protestant churches.
