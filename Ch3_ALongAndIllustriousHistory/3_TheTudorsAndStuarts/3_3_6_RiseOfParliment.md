# 3.3.6 The Rise of Parliment

## Elizabeth I's Management of Parliament:
- Elizabeth I was **adept at managing Parliament**.
- She effectively balanced her desires and opinions with those of the **House of Lords** and the increasingly **Protestant House of Commons**.

## James I and Charles I's Political Approach:
- James I and his son, **Charles I**, were *less politically skilled*.
- They adhered to the "**Divine Right of Kings,**" believing their rule was divinely ordained.
- They argued that the king should govern without parliamentary approval.

## Charles I's Conflicts with Parliament:
- Upon inheriting the thrones, Charles I attempted to rule according to the **Divine Right principle**.
- When Parliament disagreed with his religious and foreign policies, he tried to *rule without Parliament entirely*.
- He managed to *raise funds for 11 years without parliamentary consent*.
- Eventually, **unrest in Scotland** forced him to reconvene Parliament.
